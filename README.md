BUILDING INTERACTIVE JAVASCRIPT WEBSITES

Musicon Project:
In this Codecademy project, we updated the website of an online musical instruments store, Musicon. We incorporated our knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars to make a stylish multi-page interactive website!

Musicon has three separate web pages: a home page, a store page, and a contacts page. Initially the home and store pages already had most of the HTML and CSS set up. Our job was to make the following changes:

1. Create a navigation bar using unordered lists, anchor tags, and class attributes.
2. Style the website using our knowledge of display, positioning, color, and font declarations.
3. Build out semantic templates using a client-side templating engine: Handlebars.
4. Display relevant information using JavaScript objects, arrays, and control flow alongside built-in Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers.
